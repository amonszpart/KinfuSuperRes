default image, built in alignment image, good image\\
calibration papers, and their comparison of optimisation techniques\\
calibration with different sources (depth and acryl, ir, ellipses)\\
cuda mapping\\
\subsubsection{takeaway}
Ir image with and without projector\\
large checkerboard vs. small checkerboard\\
all positions (mosaic image?)\\

\subsection{Yang}
\subsection{Kinect Fusion}
\subsection{Put together}
\subsubsection{Pros}
future work: I advocate Yang for the following reasons, or I discourage, since...or in some situations this, than that \\
Kinect \\
Yang \\
\subsubsection{Limitations}
so if Kinfu is not reliable, say it! so if it does not work (pose) than \\
- misalignment, few frames later, it's great \\
    - calibration \\

\subsection{Gabe's stuff}

I'm not in the same situation

Yang is a good idea, but does it still apply?
    - 1 raw
    - Kinfu
    so, this it apply?
    
    - why use kinfu? - new rgb?
    - so, it would not matter use yang before ,since I can show it ( future work:  yang, consistent through time - point to unstructured lumigraph paper, best point of view)
    
- Kinfu and Yang state of the art methods incorporated
my text is about: Yes, A is a good idea, B is a good idea maybe, A and B is interesting, it has + and -, and in fact, there is now a more complicated outcome, because I'm in a position to (or show) that I can get a closer RGB 

(random noise, or brighter is closer)
flat depth + checkerboard rgb?

so look, this was there, Kinfu could-ve used it, it didn't, and I still can improve with this closeup rgb
- it does create new depths? - show that
- if it doesn't: A, B, A+B --> conclusions, possible, but it's not desirable. If you have RGB, and you want better, you have to have a better alrogithm, yes, cross bilt does more, but it's not amazing, because it is still filtering, (better algorithm: 

so suppress gradient, or create new ones? DECIDE

future work: object recognition on rgb, and introduce new depth

so is it suppression, or not?


- pose estimation =?= calibration



so sample the space of pose estimates, and look up paper
    or particle filter
    or anything
    show, that you can see, when it's off ,and show, that the edges are off
    
   
    
    
/ sections
simplest version: abstract, intro, related work, 
3 revisiting depth superresolution (or depth super resolution in a multi view framework, or "depth sr for kinect data"), 
3.0 overview - aiming for, diagram, (make use of kinfu, than yang, so that we can apply the detaills from various intensity images to imrpove the depth)
    - we have to recreate the system of yang
    - and we have to farm parts of the kinfu system
3.1 Yang
    - blank depth experiment
3.2 Kinfu
    - kinfu default overlay
3.3 My combined pipleine ( this is what I did, to get the data fro mhere to there. Draw attention to GPU implementations (get credit for it) )
4. Validation / experiments
    - controlled experiments, testing one variable, NOT really the problems brought attention to earlier
    - ...
    - blank image
5. discussion/conclusion
    - come back to 3's experiments
    - interpret experiments
    - did you notice, that 2 were good, and 3rd was abd, remember what I sadi in
3.2, that kinfu does it's calibration...well ,that's crap here (threshold), it happend to be good for 2 seque3nces, but not ther thireds
    5.x limitations
        - obvious (Yang on chessboard, it still does)
        - summarizing what I discovered
    5.x1 future work
        
chapter: depth image, super resolution 


experiments:
    yang on checkerboard
    yang on original yang dataset
    overlay of original vs. kinfu pose (pose estimation error)
    
    
results:
1. 3D different point of view
2. sparse 3D of different view from this viewpoint
3. dense 3D

    
reference calibration alignment algorithms (rgb to depth)

random noise or brighter is closer assumptions / papers doing a better job hallucinating
