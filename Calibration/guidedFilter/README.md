Contributed by Kaiming He (hkm007@ie.cuhk.edu.hk)

Please note that the running time reported in the paper is from C++ implementation.

## Usage:

* guidedfilter.m - guided filter implementation (Eqn(5), (6), (8) in the paper)

* guidedfilter_color.m - guided filter for color guidance (Eqn(14), (15), (16) in the paper)

Run the four examples to see the results shown in the paper.

## Update:
